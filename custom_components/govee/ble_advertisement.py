"""BLE advertisement subscription + correlation handler.

Extracted from coordinator.py for cohesion (audit H1). Holds the BLE
subscription bookkeeping and the correlation logic that maps an
incoming advertisement to a known cloud device, then enrolls the device
for BLE command dispatch when the SKU is on the verified allowlist.

The handler holds a reference to the coordinator and operates on its
mutable state (``_devices``, ``_ble_devices``, ``_states``, transport
tracker). This is code organization, not coupling reduction —
extracting LOC from the 1697-line monolith without redesigning the
data flow.
